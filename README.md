## Game Introduction ##
Ludo is a board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to die rolls. Like other cross and circle games, Ludo is derived from the Indian game Pachisi, but simpler.
The game and its variants are popular in many countries and under various names including Pakistan. This document will explain functional and non-functional requirements of this game.

## Project Description ##
At minimum two, three, or four players can play. At start each player will have four tokens. Moves will be in clock wise direction. Each token can be started to play (from starting square) only when player gets six on dice role (first time only for each token) otherwise turn will move to next player.
Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forward along the track. The token will be moved number of squares indicated by the die (e.g. if die rolls to four, token will move four squares ahead). If no move is possible, the turn will pass to the next player. If die rolls to six (6), the player may choose to advance a token already in play, or, may enter another staged token to its starting square. Rolling a six (6) earns the player an additional or “bonus” roll in that turn. If the additional roll results in a six (6) again, the player earns an additional bonus roll. If the third roll is also a six (6), the player may not move and the turn immediately passes to the next player. Players may not end their move on a square they already occupy. If a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent’s token, the opponent token is returned to its owner’s yard. The returned token may only be reentered into play when the owner rolls a six (6). A player’s home column squares are always safe because no opponent may enter them.


## How to Run ##
When you open the project in unity then in project section open "Scenes folder" and click on Main Menu scene after that play the game you will see main menu screen. I will show all the steps in my video.


## Problems Faced ##
We have not used unity before this is the main problem we faced. During the project we have faced many difficulties regarding unity software.

### Problem 1: I don't know how to Code ###
No Coding is not that difficult its easy we just need time to understand the concept. Bulding tha concepts are the main part where we took time in this project.
